
# SwEnt Milestone 1 Feedback

This first milestone M1 serves as a checkpoint at which we provide you with formal feedback on how you are coming together as a team, organizing yourselves, adopting good software engineering practices, and making progress toward delivering incremental value to your users. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The goal of our evaluation is not to assess whether you are top-tier Android developers or software testers, this will be assessed in earnest in subsequent milestones, once you've had the opportunity to gain experience and acquire the relevant skills. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M1 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) document.

We looked at several aspects, grouped into three categories: app design, app quality & delivery, and Scrum.

# App Design

## Architecture

We looked at the high-level design of your app. We checked whether the UI, data layer, and corresponding dependencies are present. We evaluated whether your architecture diagram is of good quality and reflects the architecture of the app.

Gret Job, all layers are present and well completed.
Diagram is very qualitative and reflects well the architecture of your app, great work.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 5.

## Implementation

We looked at several implementation aspects, such as whether authentication is done safely, whether all sensitive data is properly safeguarded using crypto and secure APIs, and whether the permissions requested by your app are truly needed.

Safe authentication, good job.
All the API keys are protected and not publicely available.
Request permissions to use camera are needed and present, good job on that.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 5.

## Figma

We reviewed how you used Figma in these first Sprints of your project. We took into account whether you had done wireframes and mockups, whether these contained the main application flows and the core features, and whether the screens were linked. Overall, we wanted to see whether it's clear how the pieces work together.

Wireframe & Mockup are both present.
The mockup is clean and contains the main screens and features implemented. However the wireframe is incomplete.. It only contains one user story (the authentication user story).
Apart from the fact that there is only one user story in the wireframe, the screens are linked together and you can clearly see how you go from one screen to another.

For this part, you received 12 points out of a maximum of 15.

## UI

We checked whether the elements of your app's UI are consistent (fonts, colors, etc.) and whether the layout is responsive (i.e., adapts to different screen sizes and orientations).

UI colors and fonts are consistent.
Layout is responsive.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 5.

# Quality & Delivery

## Automated Testing

We looked at whether you configured your CI to integrate with Sonar, whether your CI passes, and of course whether your CI automatically runs the test suite. Then we checked the statement coverage achieved by your test suite. We also looked at whether you have at least one meaningful UI test per screen, one meaningful unit test per repository, one meaningful unit test per view-model, and one meaningful end-to-end test.

It seems like you tried to configure CI to run Sonar in the test.yml (CI - Test Runner) but not configured properly. Why are there 2 yml files in the workflow? Why is the Quality gate passing on your CI's when there is no code coverage generated?
In the last merge the CI (pull request) was cancelled but in previous merges the CI passes.
Tests are correctly run by the CI.
The coverage is of 75%.
Good job on including multiple meaningul UI tests per screen.
Really good unit tests per repo (many tests) but what is the difference between the 2 files: "FoodItemRepositoryFirestoreTest" and "FoodItemRepositoryFirestormTest".
No tests for BarcodeScannerViewModel or HouseholdViewModel or ListRecipesViewModel.
No end-to-end test...

For this part, you received 18 points out of a maximum of 33.

## Automated Delivery

We checked whether you have set up your CI to automatically build the APK, and it does so successfully. We also wanted to see if the APK could be installed and run on a real device.

We have found your app-debug.apk in the releases folder but your CI should automatically build the apk. The artifact is not correctly uploaded.
The APK run well on the device.

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 7.

## End-to-End Application Behavior

We then interacted with your app manually, this was fun. We flagged any problems we encountered, such as crashes or bugs, and we classified the bugs into minor vs. major bugs.

It's possible to name multiple households the same (this should not be the case unless correctly justified), UI is a little strange on the overview screen (food items should be cards or something but right now it's not very nice).
When searching for a recipe, the query is not visible.
Application crashes when opening profile screen. Moreover, when scanning a barcode and submitting it the app crashes.

For this part, you have been penalized -6 points.

# Scrum

## Documents

The main things we looked for was whether you documented your team Retrospective and Stand-Up in a timely and thorough manner.

Good Team Retro.
Good standup sheet.

For this part, you received 10 points out of a maximum of 10.

## Backlogs & Planning

We analyzed your product backlog, Sprint 3 backlog, and the Scrum board. For the PB, we checked whether it was up-to-date and whether you had populated it with user stories for the first epic and for a second epic. For the Sprint 3 backlog, we looked at whether it was up-to-date and whether the task descriptions were clear. We looked at whether tasks were assigned, whether they had a time estimate, and whether they had a priority. Finally, we evaluated whether your
Scrum board was up-to-date and ready for Sprint 3.

You still have not given the elements priorities or sorted them by priority. Moreover, terminated tasks should not be in the product backlog anymore.
Task #48 has not been assigned to anyone and is marked as completed?
Some tasks in your sprint 3 backlog are missing an estimate.
Some tasks in your sprint 3 backlog are missing priority estimates.

For this part, you received 15 points out of a maximum of 20.

Based on the above points, your intermediate grade for this milestone M1 is 4.50. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/private/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Good luck for the next Sprints!
